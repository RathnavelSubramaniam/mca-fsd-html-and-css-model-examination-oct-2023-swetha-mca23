				<p>At Sasurie, we always believe in equipping our students with the right talent and personality to meet the industry requirements. Our focus on placement centers on creating new approaches to attract the best from the industry to our campus.

					At Sasurie, Placement time is not a mere annual ritual; it is a time for showcasing the very best in our young engineers to the industrial and corporate world. The Department Placement & Career Development (DPCD) functions with the primary objective of placing students in top-notch companies even before they have completed their courses. The DPCD goes all out to train the students to meet the high industry expectations.
					
					This department is run by a Placement Director and a full time permanent coordinator. The placement office ensures and takes care to provide the best arrangements and hospitality for the visiting company officials. The placement office, functions in a separate air conditioned block with all audio visual facilities for PPT, written test, group discussions and interviews and has rapidly progressed over the years in enhancing the placement potential effectively. It plays a vital role in counseling and guiding the students of the college for their successful career placement.</p><br><br>
					<p>Education is a reflection of good civilisation, which helps us to be a good being. Our college works to mould the young minds. We just not only educate the students but also how to apply the source of knowledge in the society, when it is in need. We believe in literal practice than the text books. We teach them how to combat in this competitive world, which prevents from the alienation.

						Our institution’s main focus is to yield wakefulness for the students about their social and national responsibilities. We provide wide opportunities for the student’s right from the first year in many sorts of events, which establish their self- confidence to stand unique from others.
						
						Our institutions, motive was put together in a word called “Education” like “Gurukulam” where we teach not only about the texts but about all the ethic, tactics and values of moral life.
						
						We appreciate the soulful education agility than the mechanical systems.
						
						We work hard to bring out the intensive and critical thinking ideas among the students, also to open the young mind for their abundance triumph.</p>
